# IPA Distribution class example

## What is this example

This example PHP script finds all the IPA files in the current directory and throws them to the IPA Distribution class, which creates the Wireless Manifest for iOS Wireless App Distribution. If any Provision Profiles are found in the same directory it will mach them.

With every IPA file it finds it creates an list item with the icon (if available) and name which links to the manifest file so you can install the app on your iOS 4 device. If the Provision Profile is found it will create a list item beneath the app so this can be installed too.

The whole page is styled with the CSS from UiUIKit Framework, this creates the native look it has.
